# Task Statements
## Explore Artificial Intelligence
We know AI is one of the most popular topics to explore, and we want to challenge you to spend some time this weekend learning more about it. If you’re already familiar, take some time to dive deeper. If you’re new to the topic, follow a tutorial or just spend some time watching videos or reading guides. Tell us what you learned on the Weekend Devpost.

## Hey, Computer, what’s that?
Use computer vision or image recognition to complete this challenge. Maybe you want to recognize common objects and read them aloud or analyze video to provide the watcher with extra context. Whatever you build, submit it on our Weekend Devpost.

## Use Computer Vision
What if your garbage can could sort your recycling and compost out for you? Build a project that uses computer vision to accomplish a task. Maybe your hack analyzes garbage and sorts it into its respective kind. Submit your hack on our Week-Long Devpost!
